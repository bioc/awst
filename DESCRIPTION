Description:
    We propose an Asymmetric Within-Sample Transformation (AWST)
    to regularize RNA-seq read counts and reduce the effect of noise
    on the classification of samples. AWST comprises two main steps:
    standardization and smoothing. These steps transform gene expression data to
    reduce the noise of the lowly expressed features, which suffer from
    background effects and low signal-to-noise ratio, and the influence of the
    highly expressed features, which may be the result of amplification bias
    and other experimental artifacts.
